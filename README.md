# Weather Forecasts w/ Hashes

You are a weather reporter for the local news station.  You get data feeds from
several different sources, and you need to be able to analyze them and extract
the high and low temperatures for each day.

## Instructions

Run `ruby 00_array_of_strings.rb` and look at the output.  Your mission, should you choose
to accept it, is to get all of the other levels to print out with _exactly_ the
same output.

So if you run `ruby 02_hash_with_simple_array.rb` the output should be identical to the
output of `ruby 00_array_of_strings.rb` - that's how you know you've done the right thing.

See the `00` and `01` files for examples.
